## Procedure to use OCI Generative AI Playground.

The playground is a visual interface for exploring the hosted pretrained and custom models without writing a single line of code. Use the playground to test your use cases and refine prompts and parameters. When you're happy with the results, you can view the code and integrate Generative AI into your applications.

### Procedure 

- Use `OCI console` > `Analytics & AI` > `Generative AI`
- Click `Playground`.
